# Domains That You Can Register with Amazon Route 53<a name="registrar-tld-list"></a>

The following lists of generic and geographic top\-level domains show the top\-level domains \(TLDs\) that you can use to register domains with Amazon Route 53\. We continue to add support for more TLDs, and we decide which TLDs to add based in part on customer feedback\. To suggest a TLD that you'd like us to add, enter a comment on the [Amazon Route 53 Domain Registration forum](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=214)\.

**Registering domains with Route 53**  
You can register a domain with Route 53 if the TLD is included on the following lists\. If the TLD isn't included, you can't register the domain with Route 53\. 

**Transferring domains to Route 53**  
You can transfer a domain to Route 53 if the TLD is included on the following lists\. If the TLD isn’t included, you can't transfer the domain to Route 53\.  
For most TLDs, you need to get an authorization code from the current registrar to transfer a domain\. To determine whether you need an authorization code, see the "Authorization code required for transfer to Route 53" section for your TLD\.

## Geographic Top\-Level Domains<a name="registrar-tld-list-geographic"></a>

The following domain extensions are grouped by geography and include official country\-specific extensions, known as *country code top\-level domains* \(ccTLDs\)\. Examples include \.be \(Belgium\), \.in \(India\), and \.mx \(Mexico\)\. The rules for registration of ccTLDs vary by country\. Some countries are unrestricted, meaning that anyone in the world can register, while others have certain restrictions, such as residency\. 

Not all ccTLDs support internationalized domain names \(IDNs\)\. The following list indicates whether each ccTLD supports IDNs\. For more information about internationalized domain names, see [DNS Domain Name Format](DomainNameFormat.md)\.

If you registered a \.co\.uk, \.me\.uk, or \.org\.uk domain on or before October 28, 2013, you have priority for registering the corresponding \.uk domain until June 10, 2019\.  
You cannot register a \.uk domain \(such as example\.uk\) for which someone else has already registered a \.co\.uk, \.me\.uk, or \.org\.uk domain \(such as example\.co\.uk\) until the priority period has expired\.
If different registrants have registered the same name with \.co\.uk, \.me\.uk, and \.org\.uk TLDs \(such as example\.co\.uk, example\.me\.uk, and example\.org\.uk\), priority for registering the \.uk domain name is in the following order:

+ The registrant of the \.me\.uk domain
If you registered a \.co\.uk domain between October 29, 2013 and June 10, 2014, you have priority for registering the corresponding \.uk domain until June 10, 2019 unless someone else registered the corresponding \.org\.uk or \.me\.uk domain on or before October 28, 2013\.

If you registered a \.co\.uk domain between October 29, 2013 and June 10, 2014, you have priority for registering the corresponding \.uk domain until June 10, 2019 unless someone else registered the corresponding \.org\.uk or \.me\.uk domain on or before October 28, 2013\.  
For more information, see [\.uk Rights FAQs](https://www.theukdomain.uk/advice/do-i-have-uk-rights/uk-rights-faqs/)\.  
If you want the \.uk domain for a \.co\.uk, \.me\.uk, or \.org\.uk that you already own, use the Route 53 console or API, the AWS CLI, or the SDKs to register the \.uk domain as you would any other domain\. If someone else has a higher priority on an existing \.co\.uk, \.me\.uk, or \.org\.uk domain, we'll notify you by email\. The email will contain the following text:   
`ErrorState at registrar: 2201 : Authorization error (V334 Your request for domain 'domain name' has failed because the 'account name' for the registrant does not fully match any registrant which has rights for this domain)`

**Internationalized domain names**  
Not supported\.  
**Authorization code required for transfer to Route 53**  
If you're transferring a \.me\.uk domain to Route 53, you don't need to get an authorization code\. Instead, use the method provided by your current domain registrar to update the value of the IPS tag for the domain to **GANDI**, all uppercase\. \(An IPS tag is required by Nominet, the registry for \.uk domain names\.\) If your registrar will not change the value of the IPS tag, [contact Nominet](http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/manage-your-domain/change-registrar)\.  
When you register a \.me\.uk domain, Route 53 automatically sets the IPS tag for the domain to **GANDI**\.
