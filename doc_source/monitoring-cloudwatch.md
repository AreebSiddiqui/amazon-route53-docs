# Monitoring Your Resources with Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch"></a>

You can monitor your resources by creating Amazon Route 53 health checks, which use CloudWatch to collect and process raw data into readable, near real\-time metrics\. These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks, so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your resources are performing\. By default, metric data for Route 53 health checks is automatically sent to CloudWatch at one\-minute intervals\.

For more information about Route 53 health checks, see [Monitoring Health Checks Using CloudWatch](monitoring-health-checks.md)\. For more information about CloudWatch, see [What Is Amazon CloudWatch?](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
