# How Transferring a Domain to Amazon Route 53 Affects the Expiration Date for Your Domain Registration<a name="domain-transfer-to-route-53-expiration"></a>

When you transfer a domain between registrars, some TLD registries let you keep the same expiration date for your domain, some registries add a year to the expiration date, and some registries change the expiration date to one year after the transfer date\.

**Note**  
For most TLDs, you can extend the registration period for a domain by up to ten years after you transfer it to Amazon Route 53\. For more information, see [Extending the Registration Period for a Domain](domain-extend.md)\.

## Generic TLDs<a name="domain-transfer-to-route-53-expiration-generic"></a>

When you transfer a domain that has a generic TLD \(for example, \.com\) to Amazon Route 53, the new expiration date for the domain is the expiration date with your previous registrar plus one year\.

## Geographic TLDs<a name="domain-transfer-to-route-53-expiration-geographic"></a>

When you transfer a domain that has a geographic TLD \(for example, \.co\.uk\) to Amazon Route 53, the new expiration date for the domain depends on the TLD\. Find your TLD in the following table to determine how transferring your domain affects the expiration date\.
