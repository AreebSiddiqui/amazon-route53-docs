# Tagging Amazon Route 53 Resources<a name="tagging-resources"></a>

A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource\. Each tag consists of a *key* and a *value*, both of which you define\. For example, the key might be "domain" and the value might be "example\.com"\. You can use tags for a variety of purposes; one common use is to categorize and track your Amazon Route 53 costs\. When you apply tags to Route 53 hosted zones, domains, and health checks, AWS generates a cost allocation report as a comma\-separated value \(CSV\) file with your usage and costs aggregated by your tags\. You can apply tags that represent business categories \(such as cost centers, application names, or owners\) to organize your costs across multiple services\. For more information about using tags for cost allocation, see [Use Cost Allocation Tags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html) in the [AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/)\.

For ease of use and best results, use Tag Editor in the AWS Management Console, which provides a central, unified way to create and manage your tags\. For more information, see [Working with Tag Editor](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html) in [Getting Started with the AWS Management Console](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/getting-started.html)\. For health checks, you can also apply tags in the Route 53 console\. For more information, see [Naming and Tagging Health Checks](health-checks-tagging.md)\.

You can also apply tags to resources by using the Route 53 API\. For more information, see the actions related to tags in the topic [Route 53 API Actions by Function](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API-actions-by-function.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 API Reference*\.
