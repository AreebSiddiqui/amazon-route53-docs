# Configure records<a name="record-configure"></a>

Each record in a hosted zone defines how you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries\. You can specify the settings for multiple records and then create them all at one time\. 

This is especially useful when you create multiple records that have a routing policy other than simple because you can specify the name, type, and TTL just once\. You also can review the record values, such as IP addresses or weights, before you create the records\.
