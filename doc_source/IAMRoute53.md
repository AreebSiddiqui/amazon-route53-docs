# AWS Identity and Access Management<a name="IAMRoute53"></a>

Amazon Route 53 integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\), a service that lets your organization do the following:

+ Create users and groups under your organization's AWS account

+ Easily share your AWS account resources among the users in the account

+ Assign unique security credentials to each user

+ Granularly control user access to services and resources

For example, you can use IAM with Amazon Route 53 to control which users in your AWS account can create a new hosted zone or change resource record sets\.
