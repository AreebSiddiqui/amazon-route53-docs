Enter the name of the domain that you want to route traffic for\. Note the following:
+ You can't change the name of a hosted zone after you create it\.

+ Except in rare cases, you don't specify the name of a subdomain, such as **www\.example\.com**\.
+ If the domain name contains characters other than a\-z, 0\-9, and \- \(hyphen\), see [DNS domain name format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html)\.
