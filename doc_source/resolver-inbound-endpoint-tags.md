A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource\. Each tag consists of a *key* and an optional *value*, both of which you define\. 

Tags let you categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment\. You can also use tags to organize the costs in your AWS bill\. For example, you might specify **Cost center** for **Key** and specify **456** for **Value**\.
