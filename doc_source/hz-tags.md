A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource\. Each tag consists of a key and a value, both of which you define\. For example, you might assign a tag to a hosted zone that has the key "Customer" and the value "Example Corp\." You can use tags for a variety of purposes; one common use is to categorize and track your AWS costs\.
