You can choose whether to configure an inbound endpoint, an outbound endpoint, or both:
+ An inbound endpoint lets you forward DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Resolver in a VPC\.
+ An outbound endpoint lets you forward specified queries \(such as example\.com or example\.net\) from a VPC to resolvers on your network\.
+ Inbound and outbound endpoints let you forward queries in both directions\.
