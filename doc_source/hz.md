# Hosted zones<a name="hz"></a>

A hosted zone is a container for records\. Each record in a hosted zone contains information about how you want to route traffic for a domain, such as example\.com, and its subdomains \(acme\.example\.com, zenith\.example\.com\)\. A hosted zone and the corresponding domain have the same name\. There are two types of hosted zones:
+ *Public hosted zones* contain records that specify how you want to route traffic on the internet\.
+ *Private hosted zones* contain records that specify how you want to route traffic in a VPC\.
